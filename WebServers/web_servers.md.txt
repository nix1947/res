**Udacity web server and http course**

```bash
ncat -l 9999 # In one desktop, this run ncat as a server.
ncat localhost 9999 # In other desktop, this run ncat as a client. 
```



**Request the resource to server using `ncat`**

```bash
ncat 127.0.0.1 8000
GET /profile HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

# Response from the server is as follows.
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: SimpleHTTP/0.6 Python/3.7.0

Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 2996
```

HTTP Status code.

- **1xx — Informational.** The request is in progress or there's another step to take.
- **2xx — Success!** The request succeeded. The server is sending the data the client asked for.
- **3xx — Redirection.** The server is telling the client a different URI it should redirect to. The headers will usually contain a **Location** header with the updated URI. Different codes tell the client whether a redirect is permanent or temporary.
- **4xx — Client error.** The server didn't understand the client's request, or can't or won't fill it. Different codes tell the client whether it was a bad URI, a permissions problem, or another sort of error.
- **5xx — Server error.** Something went wrong on the server side



**Some HTTP response headers settings**

```
Cache-Control: public, max_age=259200
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

The HTTP response is made up of three parts: the status line, some headers, and a response body. ![http_response](F:\Resources\WebServers\http_response.png)
